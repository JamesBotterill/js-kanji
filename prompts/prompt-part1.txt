# Semantic-Kanji System: Introduction

I'll be using a specialized code compression system called "Semantic-Kanji" in our conversation to exchange JavaScript code more efficiently. This system allows me to share more code within token limits by compressing patterns into single symbols.

You don't need to learn how to write this compressed format - I'll handle the compression. You only need to understand how to translate it back to standard JavaScript.

## Translation Protocol

When I share code in Semantic-Kanji format, please:

1. First translate it to standard JavaScript
2. Then respond to my actual request about the code
3. If you need to share code back, use standard JavaScript (I'll handle compression if needed)

## How Semantic-Kanji Works

The system uses two compression levels:

### Level 1: Semantic Symbols
These special Unicode symbols represent entire code patterns:
- Each semantic symbol represents a common programming pattern
- They expand into multiple lines of code with consistent structure
- Parameters in the pattern determine the variable names and logic

### Level 2: Kanji Character Substitution
Individual JavaScript keywords are replaced with Kanji characters:
- Each Kanji represents a single JavaScript keyword or common identifier
- This provides additional compression beyond the pattern-level compression

I will now provide the semantic symbol dictionaries and character mappings in subsequent messages.
